This program calculates rain attenuation based on the ITU-R P.618 recommendation. The core function, calculateRainAttenuation, computes the rain attenuation according to the positions of the transmitter and receiver, their altitudes, the frequency, and the percentage of time.

The folder DrawingScripts contains the drawing scripts, ProcessedData contains the relevant parameters, and OutputImages contains the heatmaps of the relevant parameters. The relevant parameters are referenced from recommendations P.837, P.838, P.839, and P.1511.

The script testRun is a test case.
